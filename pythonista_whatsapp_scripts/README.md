# pythonista-whatsapp-scripts
A variety of scripts for use with pythonista on mobile (iOS) that "translate" whatsapp messages into different versions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```
Pythonista for iOS (http://omz-software.com/pythonista/)
WhatsApp
WhatsApp messages from someone who is dumb enough to text you
```

### Installing
1) Create a new .py file or copy/paste one of these scripts into pythonista.
2) In Pythonista, under settings -> App Extensions -> Share Extension Shortcuts, tap the '+' icon and find the script. Customise its name and icon if you wish.
3) In WhatsApp, find a message you wish to "translate". Press and hold on the message until a box comes up with "forward" as an option.
4) Press "forward", then in the bottom left find the share button (a box with an arrow pointing up from the centre). Then find "Run Pythonista Script" from this popup box, click it, and then the script you wish to run.
5) The script will copy and paste the new "translated" text to your clipboard, so that you can copy and paste it back in to the text box of the conversation.

### Notes
3 scripts are provided in this repository, but you can mess with them and come up with new translations if you wish!
